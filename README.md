# Welcome to the maze_runner!

This is a simple app to find a path in a maze. It was created to show use case of _Breadth First Search_ Algorithm and _Backtracking_.

The code in `visualization.py` is a little messy so **don't** try to **look** into it.

## How the app works
You can draw the walls and create the maze. 

In the input field enter coordinates of start position (**x_1**, **y_1**) and destination position (**x_2**, **y_2**). Hit the ENTER.

The app will show you the shortest path from _start_ to _destination_ if such path exists. If no path exists the program crashes.
